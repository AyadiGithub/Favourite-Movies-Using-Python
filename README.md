# Favourite-Movies-Using-Python
Creating a Webpage that displays movies with trailers from YouTube using Python. 

This is a project from Udacity's Introduction to Python Programming course (2017). It is a webebpage generated with python that displays my favourite movies and their trailers from YouTube.

To Run:
1. Download/clone the repository to your desktop.
2. Open the command line interface for the OS being used and change the directory to the cloned folder. 
- This can be done with the 'cd' command in Windows.
3. Run the following command: python entertainment_center.py
4. The command will create an html file 'Favourite_movies.html' and the webpage will be opened with your default web browser.
